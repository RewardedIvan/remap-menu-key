# Remap Menu Key

A mod that (kind of) fixes a [year old](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-252336) bug because mojang doesn't care about us `caps:swapescape` users :(

Adds a keybinding in the settings that lets said key be used as an alternative escape key.
This might not be cover all cases where Escape is used, so create an issue if you find your remapped escape key isn't working as expected!
By default the remapped escape key is the Caps Lock key, because it's in a much more convenient spot.
